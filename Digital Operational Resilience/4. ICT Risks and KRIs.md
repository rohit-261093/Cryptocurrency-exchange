# ICT Risks and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

## 1. Purpose

This document identifies the key ICT risks that could materially impact the organisation’s most critical Important Business Services:
- Crypto Trading Execution
- Digital Asset Custody

It also defines a focused set of **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** used to monitor these risks and support early intervention before impact tolerances are breached.

The approach is intentionally proportionate, aligning with the organisation’s size, complexity, and risk profile.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- ICT risks affecting Crypto Trading Execution
- ICT risks affecting Digital Asset Custody
- Shared ICT risks across both services

---

## 3. ICT Risk Themes

The following ICT risk themes have been identified as having the highest potential to impact in-scope services:

1. Cloud and Infrastructure Availability  
2. Cyber Security Incidents  
3. Software and Configuration Failures  
4. Data Integrity and Loss  
5. Third-Party Service Disruption  

Each risk theme is assessed based on its ability to cause service disruption beyond defined impact tolerances.

## 4. Key ICT Risks by Important Business Service

### 4.1 Crypto Trading Execution – Key ICT Risks

- Prolonged cloud infrastructure outage affecting trading systems
- Failure or degradation of market data feeds during volatile conditions
- Application defects causing order execution errors
- Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks on public APIs
- Database performance or availability issues impacting order processing

---

### 4.2 Digital Asset Custody – Key ICT Risks

- Compromise or unavailability of key management systems
- Wallet software defects resulting in incorrect transactions
- Blockchain node failures impacting transaction validation
- Unauthorised access to custody systems
- Loss or corruption of wallet configuration data

## 5. Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

KRIs are designed to provide **early warning signals** of deteriorating resilience.  
Only a small number of KRIs are used to ensure clarity and actionability.

---

### 5.1 Cloud and Infrastructure KRIs

| KRI | Description | Threshold |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| Service availability | Availability of core trading and custody platforms | < 99.9% |
| Error rate | API or service error rates | Sustained > 2% |
| Resource saturation | CPU / memory utilisation | Sustained > 80% |

---

### 5.2 Cyber Security KRIs

| KRI | Description | Threshold |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| Critical vulnerabilities | Open critical security vulnerabilities | > 7 days |
| Security incidents | Confirmed security incidents | Any |
| Privileged access changes | Unreviewed privileged access | > 24 hours |

---

### 5.3 Application and Data KRIs

| KRI | Description | Threshold |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| Failed transactions | Percentage of failed trades or transfers | Sustained > 1% |
| Data integrity issues | Detected data inconsistencies | Any |
| Backup failures | Failed backup jobs for critical data | Any |

---

### 5.4 Third-Party KRIs

| KRI | Description | Threshold |
|---|-------------|-----------|
| SLA breaches | Availability or performance SLA breaches | Any |
| Repeated outages | Multiple disruptions within a defined period | > 1 per quarter |
| Dependency concentration | Single-provider reliance for critical service | Reviewed periodically |

## 6. KRI Monitoring and Escalation

KRIs are monitored through existing monitoring, logging, and security tooling.

Escalation principles include:
- Immediate escalation for any breach relating to security or data integrity
- Management review for repeated or sustained threshold breaches
- Risk assessment and remediation tracking for material trends

KRIs inform operational decision-making and resilience prioritisation rather than serving as static compliance metrics.

---

## 7. Use of KRIs in Operational Resilience

KRIs are used to:
- Trigger proactive investigation and remediation
- Inform incident severity assessment
- Support resilience testing scenario selection
- Provide management visibility into resilience posture

KRI trends are reviewed alongside incident data and test outcomes to identify areas for improvement.
