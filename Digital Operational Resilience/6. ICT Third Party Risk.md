# Third-Party ICT Risk Management

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the organisation’s approach to managing **ICT risks arising from third-party service providers** that support Important Business Services.

The objective is to ensure that reliance on third parties does not undermine:
- Operational resilience
- Security and data protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Customer trust

The approach is proportionate to the organisation’s size and integrates with existing risk, resilience, and incident management processes.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- ICT third parties supporting Important Business Services
- Cloud and infrastructure providers
- Custody and wallet technology providers
- Market data and blockchain infrastructure providers
- Security and monitoring service providers

### Out of Scope
- Non-ICT suppliers
- Low-risk vendors with no material service dependency

## 3. Third-Party Risk Principles

Third-party ICT risk management is based on the following principles:

- **Risk-based**  
  Effort is focused on vendors whose failure could materially impact services.

- **Outcome-focused**  
  Emphasis is placed on service availability, security, and recoverability rather than vendor controls in isolation.

- **Integrated**  
  Third-party risks are considered as part of operational resilience, incident response, and ICT risk management.

- **Proportionate**  
  Controls scale with vendor criticality and organisational maturity.

## 4. Third-Party Criticality and Tiering

Third-party providers are assessed and tiered based on:
- Support for Important Business Services
- Potential customer impact if disrupted
- Data sensitivity and access
- Substitutability and concentration risk

### Example Tiering

| Tier | Description |
|----|-------------|
| **Tier 1 – Critical** | Directly supports IBS; disruption would cause material impact |
| **Tier 2 – Important** | Supports key systems but with limited workaround options |
| **Tier 3 – Low** | Minimal impact on service delivery |

Only Tier 1 and Tier 2 providers are subject to enhanced ICT risk management.

## 5. Key ICT Third-Party Risk Categories

Key ICT risks associated with third parties include:
- Availability and performance failures
- Cyber security incidents
- Data loss or integrity issues
- Concentration risk
- Limited exit or substitution options

These risks are assessed in the context of the IBS they support.

---

## 6. Due Diligence and Onboarding

For Tier 1 and Tier 2 ICT third parties, due diligence is performed prior to onboarding and includes:
- Assessment of service availability and resilience
- Review of security and access controls
- Understanding of data handling and protection measures
- Evaluation of dependency and concentration risks
- Review of incident notification and support arrangements

Where appropriate, reliance is placed on:
- Independent assurance reports
- Certifications
- Targeted questionnaires

---

## 7. Contractual and Service Expectations

Contracts with critical ICT third parties are expected to include, where proportionate:
- Defined service availability expectations
- Incident notification requirements
- Data protection and confidentiality obligations
- Support during incidents and recovery events
- Termination and exit considerations

Contractual controls are aligned with the criticality of the service provided.

---

## 8. Ongoing Monitoring and Oversight

Ongoing monitoring of critical ICT third parties includes:
- Review of service availability and performance
- Tracking of incidents and SLA breaches
- Periodic reassessment of risk and criticality
- Monitoring of changes in service scope or delivery model

Material issues are escalated through existing risk and management channels.

---

## 9. Third-Party Incidents and Operational Resilience

Third-party disruptions that impact services are managed through the **Incident Response & Post-Incident Review Framework**.

Where a third-party incident:
- Impacts an Important Business Service
- Risks breaching impact tolerances
- Has potential regulatory implications

It is treated as a material ICT incident and managed accordingly.

Lessons learned are used to:
- Reassess vendor risk
- Update dependency mapping
- Improve resilience and exit planning

---

## 10. Exit and Substitution Considerations

For critical ICT third parties, the organisation considers:
- Feasibility of alternative providers
- Internal workarounds or degraded modes
- Data portability and migration risks
- Concentration risk across services

Exit planning is pragmatic and risk-based, recognising that immediate substitution may not always be feasible.

---

## 11. Governance and Accountability

Responsibility for third-party ICT risk is shared across:
- Technology and engineering
- Information security
- Risk and compliance
- Vendor or commercial owners

Oversight focuses on ensuring that third-party risks remain within acceptable tolerance levels and are actively managed.

---

## 12. Review and Continuous Improvement

This approach to third-party ICT risk management is reviewed:
- Periodically
- Following material incidents or service disruptions
- When onboarding new critical vendors
- In response to regulatory developments

Improvements are prioritised based on risk and customer impact.
