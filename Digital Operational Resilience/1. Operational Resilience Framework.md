# Operational Resilience Framework

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Operational Resilience Framework is to define how a cryptocurrency exchange ensures the continuity of its **Important Business Services (IBS)** in the face of ICT-related disruptions.

This framework focuses on the organisation’s ability to:
- Prevent and withstand operational disruptions
- Respond effectively to incidents
- Recover within defined impact tolerances
- Learn from disruptions to continuously improve resilience

Operational Resilience extends beyond traditional Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCP/DR) by focusing on **business outcomes**, not just the recovery of systems.

---

## 2. Scope

This framework applies to:
- All Important Business Services provided to customers and market participants
- Supporting people, processes, technology, facilities, and third parties
- ICT systems, cloud infrastructure, data, and security controls
- Internal teams and external service providers

Key services in scope include, but are not limited to:
- Crypto trading execution
- Digital asset custody
- Fiat deposits and withdrawals
- Wallet transfers
- Market data and pricing services

---

## 3. Regulatory Alignment

This framework is designed to align with:
- **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)**
- Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) guidance on ICT and operational resilience
- Industry standards such as ISO 22301, ISO 27001, and NIST

Key DORA principles addressed include:
- Identification of Important Business Services
- Mapping of ICT dependencies
- Definition of impact tolerances
- Digital operational resilience testing
- ICT third-party risk management
- Governance, reporting, and continuous improvement

## 4. Operational Resilience vs BCP/DR

| Area | Operational Resilience | BCP / DR |
|----|------------------------|----------|
| Focus | Business services and customer outcomes | Recovery of systems and infrastructure |
| Time Horizon | Before, during, and after disruption | After disruption |
| Key Metric | Impact Tolerance | RTO / RPO |
| Question Answered | “How much disruption is acceptable?” | “How do we restore systems?” |

BCP and DR plans are **enablers** of Operational Resilience and are designed based on the impact tolerances defined for each Important Business Service.

---

## 5. Important Business Services (IBS)

An Important Business Service is a service provided to external users where disruption could result in:
- Harm to customers
- Financial loss
- Market instability
- Regulatory non-compliance
- Reputational damage

Each IBS is assessed independently of the underlying systems that support it.

Examples include:
- Crypto Trading Execution
- Digital Asset Custody
- Fiat Onboarding and Withdrawals

---

## 6. Impact Tolerances

For each IBS, the organisation defines **impact tolerances**, representing the maximum tolerable level of disruption.

Impact tolerances are defined across multiple dimensions:
- Maximum tolerable disruption duration
- Data integrity and confidentiality requirements
- Transaction failure thresholds
- Customer harm thresholds
- Regulatory and legal impact

Impact tolerances are **not the same as RTOs or RPOs**.  
They represent business-level limits which inform system recovery objectives.

---

## 7. Mapping of Resources and Dependencies

Each IBS is mapped to its supporting resources, including:
- Critical business functions
- ICT systems and applications
- Cloud infrastructure and regions
- Data stores
- Third-party service providers
- Key personnel and operational roles

This mapping enables the identification of:
- Single points of failure
- Concentration risk
- Hidden dependencies
- Systemic weaknesses across services

---

## 8. ICT Risk Management and KRIs

ICT risks that could threaten the delivery of IBS are identified, assessed, and monitored on an ongoing basis.

Key ICT risk categories include:
- Cloud and infrastructure failures
- Cyber security incidents
- Software and configuration errors
- Data integrity issues
- Third-party and concentration risks

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are defined to provide early warning of deteriorating resilience, such as:
- System availability metrics
- Security vulnerability exposure
- Incident frequency and severity
- Third-party SLA breaches

KRIs are monitored regularly and escalated in line with the risk governance framework.

---

## 9. Digital Operational Resilience Testing

The organisation conducts regular testing to assess its ability to remain within impact tolerances during severe but plausible disruptions.

Testing approaches include:
- Scenario-based resilience testing
- Failover and degradation testing
- Cyber incident simulations
- Third-party disruption scenarios
- Data integrity and recovery validation

Testing outcomes are documented, and identified gaps are tracked through to remediation and re-testing.

---

## 10. Incident Management and Learning

Operational disruptions and ICT-related incidents are managed through a structured incident management process that includes:
- Incident classification and severity assessment
- Decision-making and escalation thresholds
- Customer and regulatory communication triggers
- Post-incident reviews and root cause analysis

Lessons learned from incidents and tests are used to:
- Update risk assessments
- Improve controls and architecture
- Enhance BCP/DR plans
- Strengthen overall resilience

---

## 11. ICT Third-Party Risk Management

Third-party providers that support IBS are subject to enhanced resilience oversight, including:
- Criticality and risk tiering
- Due diligence and onboarding assessments
- Contractual resilience and availability requirements
- Ongoing monitoring and performance reviews
- Exit and substitution planning

Particular attention is given to:
- Cloud service providers
- Banking and payment partners
- Custody and wallet technology vendors
- Market data providers

---

## 12. Governance and Accountability

Operational Resilience is governed through:
- Senior management ownership of IBS
- Regular reporting to the Risk Management Committee
- Board-level oversight of material ICT risks and resilience posture

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined across:
- Information Security
- Technology and Engineering
- Risk and Compliance
- Operations and Customer Support
- Third-party management

---

## 13. Reporting and Metrics

Regular reporting provides transparency on:
- IBS availability and disruptions
- ICT risk exposure and KRIs
- Testing outcomes and remediation status
- Third-party resilience performance
- Emerging risks and trends

Reports are tailored for:
- Operational teams
- Senior management
- Board and Risk Committee

---

## 14. Continuous Improvement

Operational Resilience is treated as a continuous improvement process.

The framework is reviewed and updated:
- Following significant incidents
- After resilience testing exercises
- In response to regulatory or business changes
- As the threat landscape evolves

Improvements are prioritised based on risk, impact, and regulatory expectations.

---

## 15. Conclusion

This framework ensures that the organisation can continue to deliver its most important services under stress, protect customers, and meet regulatory obligations.

By integrating ICT risk management, BCP/DR, third-party oversight, and governance into a single resilience model, the organisation demonstrates a proactive and mature approach to Digital Operational Resilience.
