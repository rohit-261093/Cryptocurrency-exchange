# Recovery Testing Strategy  
Crypto Exchange Platform (AWS Environment)

This document defines the recovery testing strategy for the crypto exchange
platform. It ensures that continuity and recovery strategies and recovery
architecture are effective, repeatable, and aligned with service tiering and
business impact.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of recovery testing is to:

- Validate recovery objectives (RTO and RPO)
- Verify recovery architecture and operational readiness
- Reduce uncertainty during real incidents
- Satisfy internal governance and regulatory expectations

Recovery testing focuses on **capability validation**, not theoretical design.

---

## 2. Scope

Recovery testing applies to:

- All production services across all service tiers
- Infrastructure, application, and data recovery mechanisms
- Human decision-making and escalation paths
- External dependencies where feasible

---

## 3. Testing Principles

Recovery testing is guided by the following principles:

1. Test the highest-risk and highest-impact services first
2. Test production-like conditions wherever possible
3. Prioritize safety and data integrity over realism
4. Avoid customer impact unless explicitly approved
5. Document gaps, not just successes
6. Improve strategies and architecture based on outcomes

---

## 4. Testing Types

Recovery testing includes multiple test types, increasing in complexity and
risk.

### 4.1 Tabletop Exercises
- Scenario-based discussions
- Validate decision-making, escalation, and ownership
- No system changes

### 4.2 Technical Recovery Tests
- Infrastructure and application recovery actions
- Controlled, non-destructive testing

### 4.3 Failover Simulations
- Active promotion of standby components
- Limited production impact

### 4.4 Full-Scale Recovery Exercises
- End-to-end recovery validation
- Rare and executive-approved

---

## 5. Tier-Based Recovery Testing Strategy

---

### 5.1 Tier 0 – Systemic / Asset-Critical Services

**Services**
- Wallet Service
- Ledger / Balance Store
- Deposits and Withdrawals

**Testing Objectives**
- Validate near-zero data loss
- Confirm controlled failover procedures
- Verify post-recovery reconciliation

**Testing Approach**
| Test Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Tabletop | Custody loss and blockchain outage scenarios |
| Technical | Standby database promotion in non-prod |
| Simulation | Read-only recovery validation |

**Frequency**
- Tabletop: Quarterly
- Technical: Bi-annually
- Full-scale: Annually (non-production)

---

### 5.2 Tier 1 – Trading-Critical Services

**Services**
- Matchmaking Engine
- Trading APIs
- Market Data Services

**Testing Objectives**
- Validate leader election and failover speed
- Ensure trade correctness after recovery
- Confirm degraded-mode behavior

**Testing Approach**
| Test Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Tabletop | Trading halt and restart scenarios |
| Technical | Leader failover tests |
| Simulation | Traffic rerouting and service restart |

**Frequency**
- Tabletop: Quarterly
- Technical: Quarterly
- Full-scale: Annually

---

### 5.3 Tier 2 – Customer-Facing Non-Systemic Services

**Services**
- OTC Trading
- C2C Trading

**Testing Objectives**
- Validate manual recovery procedures
- Confirm acceptable recovery timelines

**Testing Approach**
| Test Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Tabletop | Service disable/enable scenarios |
| Technical | Manual restart and redeploy tests |

**Frequency**
- Tabletop: Bi-annually
- Technical: Annually

---

### 5.4 Tier 3 – Internal & Non-Critical Services

**Services**
- Reporting
- Admin and Backoffice Tools

**Testing Objectives**
- Confirm backup availability
- Validate rebuild procedures

**Testing Approach**
| Test Type | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Tabletop | Data loss and access disruption |
| Technical | Backup restore validation |

**Frequency**
- Tabletop: Annually
- Technical: Annually

---

## 6. Dependency Recovery Testing

### 6.1 AWS Infrastructure
- AZ failure simulations
- Auto Scaling recovery validation
- Backup restore testing

### 6.2 External Dependencies (RPC Providers)
- Provider outage simulations
- Manual switching validation
- Transaction pause and resume verification

---

## 7. Validation Criteria

Each test must validate:

- RTO and RPO compliance
- Correct execution of recovery steps
- Clear ownership and escalation
- Absence of data corruption or duplication
- Successful post-recovery validation checks

---

## 8. Documentation and Evidence

For each test:

- Test scenario and objectives documented
- Execution steps recorded
- Gaps and issues logged
- Remediation actions assigned
- Evidence retained for audit purposes

---

## 9. Governance and Reporting

- Test results are reviewed by Engineering and Security
- High-risk gaps are escalated to senior leadership
- Strategy updates follow significant findings
- Test outcomes feed into risk register updates

---

## 10. Continuous Improvement

Recovery testing is iterative:

- Failed tests drive architecture changes
- Near-misses influence strategy refinement
- Testing scope expands with platform growth

---

## 11. Outcome

This recovery testing strategy ensures that recovery capabilities are not only
designed but proven, reducing recovery risk and improving operational confidence
during real incidents.
