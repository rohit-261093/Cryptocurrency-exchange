The analysis identifies critical services, assesses their business impact,
and classifies them into service tiers to support continuity, recovery, and
resilience decision-making.

## 4. Service Tiering Model

Services are classified into tiers based on their systemic importance and
impact tolerance.

### Tier Definitions

- **Tier 0 – Systemic / Asset-Critical Services**  
  Failure may result in asset loss, ledger inconsistency, or regulatory breach.

- **Tier 1 – Trading-Critical Services**  
  Required to maintain fair, orderly, and reliable trading operations.

- **Tier 2 – Customer-Facing Non-Systemic Services**  
  Customer-visible services with extended recovery tolerance.

- **Tier 3 – Internal & Non-Critical Services**  
  Internal or informational services with minimal customer impact.
