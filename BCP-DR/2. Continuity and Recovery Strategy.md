# Continuity & Recovery Strategies  
Crypto Exchange Platform (AWS Environment)

This document defines the continuity and recovery strategies for a centralized
cryptocurrency exchange deployed on AWS. Strategies are explicitly aligned with
the service tiering model and risk and impact analysis to ensure predictable,
controlled recovery during disruptive events.

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to:

- Define how services continue operating during disruptions
- Establish recovery intent and decision boundaries
- Align recovery behavior with service tiering and business impact
- Provide a foundation for recovery architecture and DR runbooks

---

## 2. Strategy Inputs

Continuity and recovery strategies are derived from:

- Risk and Impact Analysis
- Service Tiering Model
- Regulatory and custody obligations
- Platform architecture and dependencies

Recovery behavior is driven by **service tier classification**, not uniform
availability requirements.

---

## 3. Strategy Design Principles

The following principles guide all continuity and recovery decisions:

1. Customer asset and ledger integrity take precedence over availability  
2. Trading correctness is prioritized over continuous execution  
3. Stateless services should recover automatically  
4. Stateful services require controlled failover  
5. Degraded modes are preferred over full outages  
6. Human approval is required for irreversible actions  
7. Lower-tier services must not delay higher-tier recovery  

---

## 4. Strategy Dimensions

Each service strategy is defined across the following dimensions:

1. **Availability Pattern** – Deployment and failover model  
2. **Recovery Approach** – Mechanism used to restore service  
3. **Automation Level** – Degree of automated recovery  
4. **Degraded-Mode Behavior** – Acceptable reduced functionality  
5. **Recovery Ownership** – Accountable recovery authority  
6. **Recovery Objectives** – RTO and RPO targets

## 5. Tier-Based Continuity & Recovery Strategies

---

### 5.1 Tier 0 – Systemic / Asset-Critical Services

**Services**
- Wallet Service  
- Ledger / Balance Store  
- Deposits and Withdrawals  

| Dimension | Strategy |
|--------|---------|
| Availability Pattern | Active–Passive (single writer) |
| Recovery Approach | Controlled failover with reconciliation |
| Automation Level | Semi-automated |
| Degraded-Mode Behavior | Withdrawals paused, trading may continue |
| Recovery Ownership | Engineering and Security |
| RTO | ≤ 15–30 minutes |
| RPO | Near-zero |

**Continuity Intent**  
Tier 0 services may degrade availability to protect asset integrity. No service
resumption occurs until data correctness is validated.

---

### 5.2 Tier 1 – Trading-Critical Services

**Services**
- Matchmaking Engine  
- Spot Trading APIs  
- Market Data Services  
- API Gateway / Web Layer  

| Dimension | Strategy |
|--------|---------|
| Availability Pattern | Active–Passive (stateful), Active–Active (stateless) |
| Recovery Approach | Automated failover and leader election |
| Automation Level | High |
| Degraded-Mode Behavior | Temporary trading halt or read-only mode |
| Recovery Ownership | Core and Platform Engineering |
| RTO | ≤ 5–10 minutes |
| RPO | Seconds or means-not-applicable |

**Continuity Intent**  
Short interruptions are acceptable to ensure fair and correct trading execution.

---

### 5.3 Tier 2 – Customer-Facing Non-Systemic Services

**Services**
- OTC Trading  
- C2C Trading  

| Dimension | Strategy |
|--------|---------|
| Availability Pattern | Single instance or warm standby |
| Recovery Approach | Manual restart or redeploy |
| Automation Level | Low |
| Degraded-Mode Behavior | Temporarily unavailable |
| Recovery Ownership | Operations |
| RTO | ≤ 24 hours |
| RPO | ≤ 4 hours |

**Continuity Intent**  
Tier 2 services are deprioritized during major incidents and recovered after all
Tier 0 and Tier 1 services are stable.

---

### 5.4 Tier 3 – Internal & Non-Critical Services

**Services**
- Reporting and Analytics  
- Admin and Backoffice Tools  

| Dimension | Strategy |
|--------|---------|
| Availability Pattern | Single instance |
| Recovery Approach | Restore from backup or rebuild |
| Automation Level | Minimal |
| Degraded-Mode Behavior | Service unavailable |
| Recovery Ownership | Operations |
| RTO | ≥ 48 hours |
| RPO | ≥ 24 hours |

**Continuity Intent**  
Tier 3 services have no customer-facing continuity requirement and are restored
after platform stability is achieved.

---

## 6. Cross-Tier Recovery Rules

- Tier 0 recovery actions override all other priorities
- Tier 1 recovery must not compromise Tier 0 integrity
- Tier 2 and Tier 3 recovery must not consume resources needed for higher tiers
- Recovery escalation paths are tier-dependent

---

## 7. External Dependency Strategy (RPC Providers)

Blockchain integrations rely on external RPC providers.

**Strategy**
- Multiple RPC providers configured per blockchain
- Manual provider switching during outages
- Deposits and withdrawals paused during instability

**Tier Classification**
- RPC providers are treated as Tier 0 dependencies

---

## 8. Validation and Governance

- Recovery strategies are reviewed annually
- Updates are required following:
  - Tier reclassification
  - Material architecture changes
  - Significant incidents
- Strategy compliance is validated through recovery testing

---

## 9. Outcome

These tier-aligned continuity and recovery strategies establish clear recovery
intent, reduce decision ambiguity during incidents, and provide a direct bridge
to recovery architecture and disaster recovery runbooks.
