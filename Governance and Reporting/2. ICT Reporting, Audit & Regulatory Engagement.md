# ICT Reporting, Audit & Regulatory Engagement

## 1. Purpose

This document describes how ICT risk, security, and operational resilience information is **reported, documented, and communicated** to support:
- Senior management and Board oversight
- Regulatory and supervisory engagement
- Internal and external audit activities

The approach is designed to ensure transparency, consistency, and traceability of ICT-related information.

---

## 2. Reporting Objectives

ICT reporting aims to:
- Provide timely visibility of material risks and incidents
- Support informed decision-making
- Demonstrate effective control and oversight
- Meet regulatory reporting expectations

Reporting is **selective and risk-based**, focusing on matters that could materially impact customers or regulatory obligations.

## 3. Operational and Management Reporting

### Operational Reporting
Operational-level reporting includes:
- Incident logs and timelines
- KRI monitoring and threshold breaches
- Third-party service issues
- Resilience testing outcomes

This information supports day-to-day risk management and early escalation.

### Senior Management Reporting
Senior management reporting focuses on:
- Material ICT risks and trends
- Significant incidents and near misses
- Breaches or risks to impact tolerances
- Third-party concentration or dependency risks
- Progress of remediation actions

Reports emphasise trends, root causes, and forward-looking risk.

## 4. Board / Risk Committee Reporting

Board-level reporting provides:
- Summarised views of ICT risk and resilience posture
- Overview of material incidents and outcomes
- Key themes from resilience testing and incident reviews
- Significant third-party and concentration risks
- Emerging risks requiring strategic consideration

Reporting is designed to enable effective challenge rather than operational oversight.

## 5. Regulatory Reporting and Engagement

### Regulatory Incident Reporting

Certain ICT-related incidents may trigger regulatory notification requirements.

Regulatory reporting:
- Is integrated into the Incident Response process
- Is based on incident severity and impact
- May involve initial, interim, and final notifications
- Is coordinated to ensure accuracy and consistency

Regulatory communications are documented and reviewed as part of post-incident reviews.

---

### Ongoing Regulatory Engagement

In addition to incident-driven reporting, the organisation supports:
- Supervisory requests and information sharing
- Regulatory reviews and inspections
- Follow-up actions arising from regulatory feedback

Engagement is supported by maintained documentation and evidence.

---

## 6. Audit Support and Assurance

ICT reporting and documentation support:
- Internal audit reviews
- External audit and assurance activities
- Regulatory assurance requirements

Audit support includes:
- Access to policies, procedures, and frameworks
- Evidence of control operation
- Incident and remediation records
- Resilience testing documentation

Findings from audits are tracked and addressed through existing governance processes.

---

## 7. Documentation and Evidence Management

ICT documentation is maintained to ensure:
- Clarity of roles, responsibilities, and processes
- Consistency across resilience, security, and risk artefacts
- Traceability for audit and regulatory review

Documentation includes:
- Frameworks and policies
- Risk assessments and KRIs
- Incident and post-incident reports
- Resilience testing records
- Third-party risk assessments

Documents are reviewed periodically to ensure continued relevance.

---

## 8. Link to Continuous Improvement

Reporting and regulatory engagement directly support continuous improvement by:
- Identifying control weaknesses
- Informing updates to frameworks and processes
- Driving prioritised remediation
- Enhancing resilience and risk management maturity

Lessons learned from incidents, audits, and regulatory feedback are fed back into governance and operational processes.

---

## 9. Summary

By maintaining clear reporting, effective documentation, and structured regulatory engagement, the organisation ensures transparency, accountability, and regulatory readiness.

This approach supports strong governance while remaining practical and proportionate to organisational scale.
