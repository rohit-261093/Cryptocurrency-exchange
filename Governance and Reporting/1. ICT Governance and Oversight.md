# ICT Governance & Oversight

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the organisation’s approach to **ICT governance and oversight**, ensuring that ICT risk, security, and operational resilience are managed in a clear, proportionate, and accountable manner.

The objective of governance is to:
- Provide effective oversight of ICT risks and resilience
- Enable informed decision-making by senior management
- Support accountability for Important Business Services
- Meet regulatory expectations without unnecessary complexity

This document focuses on **how decisions are made and escalated**, rather than formal organisational structures.

## 2. Governance Principles

ICT governance is guided by the following principles:

- **Proportionality**  
  Governance arrangements reflect the organisation’s size, complexity, and risk profile.

- **Accountability**  
  Clear ownership exists for services, risks, and decisions.

- **Integration**  
  ICT governance is embedded into existing operational and management processes.

- **Transparency**  
  Material risks and issues are visible to senior decision-makers.

- **Outcome-Focused**  
  Oversight prioritises customer impact, service resilience, and regulatory obligations.

## 3. Governance Scope

ICT governance covers:
- Operational resilience and continuity of Important Business Services
- Information security and access controls
- ICT risk management and KRIs
- Incident response and post-incident learning
- Third-party ICT risks
- Regulatory and audit readiness

---

## 4. Roles, Accountability, and Ownership

Governance relies on **clear ownership**, not dedicated governance bodies.

Key accountability principles include:
- Each Important Business Service has an identified owner accountable for resilience and risk
- ICT risks are owned by senior individuals with authority to drive remediation
- Incidents have a clearly assigned Incident Lead
- Third-party relationships have accountable business or technical owners

Ownership ensures that decisions during incidents and risk events are timely and effective.

## 5. Operational-Level Governance

At an operational level, governance focuses on **day-to-day risk visibility and control**, including:

- Monitoring of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
- Tracking of incidents, near misses, and service disruptions
- Oversight of third-party performance and issues
- Identification of emerging ICT risks

Operational governance ensures early detection and escalation of issues that may threaten Important Business Services.

## 6. Senior Management Oversight

Senior management oversight focuses on **material risks and trends**, rather than operational detail.

Information escalated to senior management includes:
- Significant ICT risks and control weaknesses
- Trends in KRIs indicating deteriorating resilience
- Material incidents and lessons learned
- Outcomes of resilience testing activities
- Third-party concentration or dependency risks

Senior management is responsible for:
- Prioritising remediation efforts
- Allocating resources where necessary
- Making risk acceptance or mitigation decisions

---

## 7. Board / Risk Committee Oversight

Board-level oversight focuses on **strategic and forward-looking ICT risk**, including:

- Material incidents affecting customers or market integrity
- Breaches or near-breaches of impact tolerances
- Significant changes to the ICT risk profile
- Effectiveness of operational resilience arrangements
- Key third-party dependencies and systemic risks

Information is summarised to enable effective challenge and decision-making without overwhelming detail.

---

## 8. Escalation and Decision-Making

Escalation thresholds are based on:
- Impact to Important Business Services
- Risk of breaching impact tolerances
- Data integrity or security concerns
- Regulatory or reputational implications

Where thresholds are met, issues are escalated promptly to senior management or the Board as appropriate.

---

## 9. Integration with Operational Resilience

ICT governance is closely integrated with the Operational Resilience Framework.

Governance ensures that:
- Impact tolerances are understood and applied
- Resilience testing outcomes inform oversight
- Incident learnings result in governance improvements
- ICT risks are managed in the context of business outcomes

---

## 10. Review and Continuous Improvement

This governance approach is reviewed:
- Periodically as the organisation evolves
- Following significant incidents or disruptions
- In response to regulatory feedback or expectations

Improvements are driven by experience, testing outcomes, and changes in the risk landscape.
