# Security & Access Management  
**AWS-Based Cryptocurrency Exchange**

---

## Overview

This folder contains a set of **Security and Access Management standards** designed for an **AWS-first cryptocurrency exchange** operating in a regulated environment.

The standards demonstrate how security controls can be:
- Risk‑based
- Cloud‑native
- Crypto‑asset aware
- Regulator‑ready
- Backed by concrete, auditable AWS evidence

They are written to reflect how a real exchange would design, operate, and evidence controls under:
- **DORA**
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**

---

## Scope

The standards in this folder cover the **core technical control domains** required to protect:

- Customer assets and private keys
- Trading platforms and APIs
- Wallet infrastructure (hot, warm, cold)
- Identity, privileged access, and network boundaries
- Cloud-native workloads at scale

They assume:
- ✅ 100% **AWS-based infrastructure**
- ✅ Multi-account, production-grade cloud architecture
- ✅ Continuous operation (trading uptime is critical)
- ✅ Strong separation of duties and least privilege
- ✅ Regulatory oversight (e.g. EU / CBI / DORA)
