# Cyber Security Controls Framework

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **Cyber Security Controls Framework** for a cryptocurrency exchange, setting out how cyber security is governed, applied, and maintained across the organisation.

The framework recognises that cyber security risk is a **core business risk** for a cryptocurrency company due to:
- direct custody of customer assets
- real-time trading activity
- high levels of automation
- dependency on external blockchain and cloud services

The objective of the framework is to ensure that cyber security controls are:
- aligned to business outcomes
- proportionate to organisational scale
- integrated with operational resilience and governance
- capable of evolving as the business grows

---

## 2. Scope and Applicability

This framework applies across the organisation and covers:
- employees, contractors, and service accounts
- internally operated systems and services
- third-party services supporting core exchange functions
- data, credentials, and cryptographic material

It applies specifically to services supporting:
- Crypto Trading Execution
- Digital Asset Custody

## 3. Cyber Security Control Philosophy

The organisation’s approach to cyber security is based on the following principles:

- **Business-Critical Focus**  
  Security controls prioritise services whose compromise would directly impact customers or market integrity.

- **Assumed Breach Mindset**  
  Controls are designed on the basis that preventative measures may fail and detection and response are essential.

- **Clear Accountability**  
  Security responsibilities are owned by the business and technology leadership, not isolated teams.

- **Proportionate Control Design**  
  Controls are selected and operated based on risk, not theoretical best practice.

- **Operational Integration**  
  Cyber security is embedded into change, incident response, and resilience activities.

## 4. Governance and Ownership of Cyber Security

Cyber security is governed as an organisational responsibility.

Key governance elements include:
- defined ownership of cyber risks affecting critical services
- integration of cyber risk into ICT and operational risk discussions
- escalation of material security concerns through established governance forums
- documented acceptance of residual cyber risk where appropriate

Cyber security governance aligns with the organisation’s broader ICT governance and reporting arrangements.

## 5. Understanding What Must Be Protected

The organisation maintains an understanding of:
- which services are critical to customers
- which systems support those services
- which data and digital assets require heightened protection
- where dependencies exist on third-party providers or blockchain networks

This understanding is maintained through:
- high-level architecture documentation
- dependency mapping activities
- regular review following material system or service changes

This visibility underpins all cyber security decision-making.

## 6. Control of Identity and Access

The organisation manages access to systems and services as a **business risk**, not a technical convenience.

Access control is governed by:
- clear identification of who requires access and why
- alignment of access rights to business responsibilities
- removal or adjustment of access when roles change
- heightened scrutiny of access to systems supporting custody and trading

Privileged access is treated as exceptional and subject to additional oversight due to the potential impact of misuse or compromise.

---

## 7. Protection of Sensitive Information and Digital Assets

The organisation applies additional protection to:
- customer personal and transactional data
- credentials and secrets used by systems
- cryptographic material supporting digital asset custody

Protection measures focus on:
- restricting access to authorised individuals and systems
- reducing unnecessary exposure of sensitive material
- ensuring recoverability in the event of loss or corruption

The framework intentionally avoids prescriptive cryptographic designs, focusing instead on governance and control intent.

---

## 8. Security Monitoring and Awareness

The organisation maintains visibility of security-relevant activity across critical systems.

Monitoring focuses on:
- access to sensitive and privileged systems
- unusual or unexpected activity patterns
- indicators of compromise that could impact services

Security monitoring supports early detection and enables timely escalation into incident response processes.

---

## 9. Cyber Security Incident Management

Cyber security incidents are managed as **business-impacting events**, not purely technical failures.

Incident management:
- is integrated with the Incident Response & Post-Incident Review Framework
- considers impact to customers, services, and regulatory obligations
- supports rapid containment and recovery
- includes structured post-incident learning

Where required, cyber incidents are assessed for regulatory notification and reporting.

---

## 10. Third-Party and Ecosystem Security

The organisation recognises that a significant portion of cyber risk arises from:
- cloud service providers
- custody and blockchain infrastructure
- external service integrations

Cyber security controls therefore extend beyond organisational boundaries and include:
- risk-based assessment of third-party services
- governance of third-party access
- consideration of dependency and concentration risk
- integration of third-party incidents into internal response processes

---

## 11. Relationship to Operational Resilience

Cyber security controls directly support operational resilience by:
- reducing the likelihood of disruptive events
- limiting the impact of security failures
- enabling effective recovery of critical services

Security considerations are embedded into:
- resilience testing scenarios
- impact tolerance assessments
- post-incident reviews

---

## 12. Assurance, Reporting, and Continuous Improvement

The effectiveness of cyber security controls is assessed through:
- incident analysis and trends
- risk indicators and management reporting
- audit and regulatory engagement
- outcomes from resilience testing

The framework is reviewed periodically and updated in response to:
- changes in the threat landscape
- business growth or architectural change
- lessons learned from incidents
- regulatory feedback
